How To Play:

The player can use keys-WASD to control the pink paddle to move around.
There are two kinds of balls in scene: Green Shooting Star and Pink Snitch.
When the AI paddle collide with Pink Snitch, AI paddle would create two new Green Shooting Stars. At the time, you would get 2 points (shown on the top of screen).
If the player collide with Green Shooting Stars, the paddle would become shorter. The player should try how many points he/she would get before destroyed.
If the player coolide with Pink Snitch, some Green Shooting Stars would be destroyed to help the player survive longer.

Visual Design:

Make the court's wall as the pixel style.
Make the ball's trail like the comet.

The design of the color and gameplay refer to one of my favorite games - Bullet Waltz.
